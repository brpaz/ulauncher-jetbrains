## Extension status

Many thanks for your interest on this extension. This extension is now deprecated in favour of [ulauncher-jetbrains-reloaded](https://github.com/gringofe/ulauncher-jetbrains-reloaded/blob/master/README.md). Please migrate to the new one. ItÂ´s based on my extension with same improvements.
